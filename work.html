									<h2>Data Scientist, Carelon Global Solutions</h2>

									<p>• Developed and implemented Machine Learning models and recommendation systems, utilizing traditional algorithms and Data Science techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), spaCy, Cosine similarity, popularity, and uniqueness to extract features from historical data. Utilized BERT for automation and assistance in healthcare applications.</p>
									<p>• Employed Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and evaluation metrics including MAP@K, MRR, NDCG, and Recall@K during model exploration and evaluation. Emphasized data consolidation and feature selection to improve model performance. </p>
									<p>• Worked on Kubeflow AWS, S3 and GlueDB, Proof of Concept  on Self care management tool. Developed care plans for healthcare programs, offering guidelines, goals, and interventions based on patient assessment responses.</p>
									<p>• Healthcare-related articles were extracted via web scraping methods and subsequently loaded into Opensearch, to enable patients or care managers to query and retrieve articles specific to their conditions. </p>

									<h2>AI Engineer, Carelon Global Solutions</h2>
									<p> 
										• Integrated Machine Learning models into the ENSO pipeline for real-time execution and developed various APIs.</p>

									<p>	• Designed and deployed automation for care plan flow, integrating rule-based models and building APIs to process patient assessment responses in real-time, utilizing data from MongoDB or Redis.</p>
									
									<p> • Developed Splunk Dashboards to capture metrics from user feedback on care plan recommendations, contributing to model enhancement.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Python Developer, Carelon Global Solutions</h2>
									<p> • Enhanced the IBM Watson Assistant Skill, a chatbot for effective interaction and service provision on a web portal. </p>
									<p>• Automated metrics generation from chatbot conversations and scheduled a Lambda function to extract conversational data from IBM object storage to S3. </p>
									<p> • Developed basic sentiment analysis on conversational data and conducted a Proof of Concept on AWS Glue and DynamoDB..</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Research intern, SensorDrops Networks Pvt Ltd. (STEP at IIT Kharagpur)</h2>
									<p> • During Covid, developed a Realtime Social Distance Monitoring System based on computer vision using YOLO V3 model for object (person) detection, which is used for calculating and monitoring social distancing. </p>
									<p> • Developed a website that can live stream four cameras at a time and display various metrics on daily, weekly and monthly basis. Hosted this video surveillance system application in AWS EC2 for better accessibility and scalability.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Research intern, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune</h2>
									<p> • Developed a prototype of Customized deep CNN based model to identify covid infected chest X-rays. This was implemented on HPC using three classes of chest X-ray images namely covid, non-covid and normal for training. </p>
									<p> • An improvement on VOS and VOT along with CNN-based semi-supervised learning techniques were implemented.</p>
