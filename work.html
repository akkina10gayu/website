									<h2>Data Scientist, Carelon Global Solutions</h2>

									<p>• Designing and developing Machine Learning models and recommendation systems using traditional algorithms along with Data Science concepts like NER, spaCy, Cosine similarity, popularity, uniqueness to generate features from the historic data and BERT to automate and assist health care.</p>
									<p>• During exploration and evaluation of the model, Logistic Reg, Random Forest, XGBoost, MAP@K, MRR, NDCG, Recall@K are used, focusing data consolidation and feature selection for enhancing the model. </p>
									<p>• Worked on Kubeflow AWS, S3 and GlueDB, PoC on Self care management tool</p>
									<p>• I developed careplans for various health care programs that provide relevant guidelines, goals and interventions as recommendation to the care manager based on the assessment response of the patient's health condition. </p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>AI Engineer, Carelon Global Solutions</h2>
									<p> 
										• I have experience in integrating ML models in the ENSO pipeline for real-time execution and building various APIs.  </p>

									<p>	• Developed and deployed the careplan flow automation which includes integration of rule based model along with building APIs that receives the assessment responses on patient's health conditions, executes and responds back with careplan as a recommendation using the data from MongoDB or Redis in real time.</p>
									
									<p> • Developed Splunk Dashboard with various metrics generated and captured from the user feedback on the care plan recommendations that contributes in Model enhancement.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Python Developer, Carelon Global Solutions</h2>
									<p> • Worked on enhancing the IBM Watson Assistant Skill, a chat bot for providing effective interaction and services to the users of a web portal. </p>
									<p>• I have also worked on metrics automation to generate required metrics from the chat bot conversations and scheduling a Lambda function to extract the conversational data from IBM object storage to S3. </p>
									<p> • Developed basic sentiment analysis on the conversational data and a PoC on  AWS Glue, dynamoDB.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Software Development intern, SensorDrops Networks Pvt Ltd. (STEP at IIT Kharagpur)</h2>
									<p> • During Covid, developed a Realtime Social Distance Monitoring System based on computer vision using YOLO V3 model for object (person) detection, which is used for calculating and monitoring social distancing. </p>
									<p> • Developed a website that can live stream four cameras at a time and display various metrics on daily, weekly and monthly basis. Hosted this video surveillance system application in AWS EC2 for better accessibility and scalability.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Software Development intern, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune</h2>
									<p> • Developed a prototype of Customized deep CNN based model to identify covid infected chest X-rays. This was implemented on HPC using three classes of chest X-ray images namely covid, non-covid and normal for training. </p>
									<p> • An improvement on VOS and VOT along with CNN-based semi-supervised learning techniques were implemented.</p>
